                            seriously though, how hard does it feel sometimes to write an introduction for something like this? I'm not even entirely sure what 'this' is just yet, outside of a place for me to share some things to the world and hopefully provide value to others through that sharing. That's a big part of what life is right? Experiencing & sharing those experiences to help us all navigate future experiences a little easier. So I'm just doing that.
                            <br /><br />
                            The initial goals were to setup & harden a VPS & learn some transferrable linux & coding skills in the process that can be used for many other things, which I've done & I'm proud of. I would love to achieve locational freedom & the ability to earn money from anywhere so that's definitely a goal.
                            <br /><br />Self-sovereignty is always the goal. <br /><br />Learning about computers, AI, crypto & improving my tech skills seems like a strong path towards that so I've just been on a multi-year journey to do that basically.<br /><br />
                            I'm not sure where it will all take me just yet but I'm proud of the challenges I've overcome to get to here.
                            <br /><br />
                            I know I have the brain to achieve anything I want to achieve if I can survive long enough and keep looking forward. My interests are pretty broad but centred around freedom enhancing tech, privacy & decentralizing away from heavily centralized power structures that seek to further concentrate that power at the expense of others. I believe in groups of people to coordinate, solve problems together while having some fun. It's a larger topic of course but generally, I think we are more capable as a collective to make good decisions for each other than the current structures suggest and would have most believe.
                            <br /><br />
                            I'm also interested in preventative medicine, brain health, psychedelics and exploring human consciousness, among other things, so I will likely share a bit about that along the way too!<br /><br />
                            Ok how did I do? That's a bit about me anyway. Will probably change and look different in a few weeks. Most importantly, I just look forward to learning more, having some fun and sincerely hope you find some value through what I share on my little patch of the internet as it evolves. No big promises, just me, experiencing the world & sharing a bit along the way.
                            <br /><br />Be kind to yourself ðŸ’š <br />
